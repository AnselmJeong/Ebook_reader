## Product Requirement Document: E-Reader Application (Detailed)

## 1. Overview

This document provides a detailed specification for an e-reader application designed to operate on web platforms initially, with future support for desktop environments using Flutter. The application will emulate the functionality and user interface observed in the provided images, including library management, customizable reading experiences for EPUB and PDF files, text highlighting, and an integrated AI chat feature for selected text.

## 2. Objectives

- Create a user-friendly e-reader with a library interface resembling the book cover grid layout shown in the images.
- Enable reading customization (zoom for PDFs, font size for EPUBs) and chapter navigation as seen in the content views.
- Implement a highlighting feature with persistent storage, mirroring the interactive text selection in the images.
- Integrate an AI chat system triggered by text selection, similar to the chat interface shown, with conversation history saved.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Library Management

- **Import Functionality**: Users can upload EPUB and PDF files via a drag-and-drop or file picker interface, similar to a digital bookshelf. Imported files are processed and thumbnails generated (e.g., book covers as seen in the "Most popular" and "Recently added" sections).
- **Book Display**: Display imported books in a grid layout with book covers, titles, authors, and availability status (e.g., "Free" as shown). Support categorization into sections like "Most popular" or "Recently added" with a "SHOW ALL" button for extended views.
- **Storage**: Maintain a persistent library using local storage or a database, ensuring books are accessible across sessions, reflecting the consistent library view in the images.

### 3.2 Reading Experience

- **File Opening**: Upon selecting a book from the library, open it in a full-screen reader view displaying the content, mimicking the layout of pages 5 and 30 from the PDF and EPUB examples.
- **Zoom Level (PDF)**: Provide a zoom slider or +/- buttons (e.g., similar to the AA icon in the chat interface) to adjust PDF content magnification, ranging from 50% to 200%.
- **Font Size (EPUB)**: Offer a font size adjustment option (e.g., small, medium, large) accessible via a settings menu, adjustable in real-time as seen in the text rendering of page 30.
- **Navigation**: Include a sidebar or table of contents (e.g., as shown on page 5 with "Part 1 - The Old Buccaneer" chapters) allowing users to jump to specific chapters or sections.

### 3.3 Highlighting

- **Highlighting Tool**: Enable text selection with a highlight option (e.g., yellow or custom colors) activated by long-press or double-click, similar to the interactive text in the images. Highlighted text should be visually distinct.
- **Persistent Storage**: Save highlights in a local database with book ID, page number, and highlighted text coordinates. Upon reopening the book, display highlights as seen in the consistent rendering of the chat interface history.

### 3.4 AI Interaction

- **Contextual Chat**: Right-clicking selected text opens a pop-up chat window (e.g., as shown in the "Books Pro AI Chat" interface) with an AI assistant. The chat should display the selected text as the query context.
- **Query Capability**: Allow users to type questions about the selected text (e.g., "What is the most whimsical character?" from the chat log), with the AI providing responses based on the text and general knowledge.
- **Conversation Storage**: Save chat history in a database, linked to the book and page, mirroring the threaded conversation format in the images (e.g., numbered responses and follow-ups).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Platforms**: Initial web deployment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Flutter support for desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) planned, ensuring cross-platform consistency.
- **Performance**: Load books and render pages within 2 seconds, with zoom and font adjustments applied instantly, as inferred from the smooth interface in the images.
- **Usability**: Design an intuitive UI with clear icons (e.g., magnifying glass, chat bubble) and responsive layouts, matching the navigation and interaction style of the provided screenshots.
- **Security**: Encrypt highlight and chat data using AES-256, ensuring user privacy as implied by the personal interaction context.

## 5. User Interface

- **Library View**: A grid layout with book covers (e.g., 3x3 grid as seen in the "Most popular" section), including title, author, and status below each cover. Include a search bar and category filters.
- **Reader View**: Full-screen mode with a scrollable content area, a left or right sidebar for chapter navigation (e.g., page 5), and a top toolbar for zoom/font settings.
- **Highlight Tool**: Highlighted text in a distinct color (e.g., yellow) with a right-click menu option to open AI chat, as suggested by the interactive text selection.
- **AI Chat**: A floating window with a text input field, send button, and conversation log (e.g., numbered responses as in the chat screenshot), minimizing to a chat icon when closed.

## 6. Technical Requirements

- **Frameworks**: Web stack (React/Angular/Vue.js) with Flutter for desktop, ensuring responsive design across devices.
- **Database**: SQLite or IndexedDB for local storage of library, highlights, and chat history, synchronized across sessions.
- **AI Integration**: Embed or connect to an AI API (e.g., xAI's Grok 3) for text analysis, supporting natural language queries and responses.

## 7. Constraints

- Initial release targets web platforms only, with desktop Flutter support as a Phase 2 feature.
- No support for audio or video content within books.
- AI responses limited to text-based analysis, no image generation unless explicitly requested and confirmed.

## 8. Future Considerations

- Implement Flutter desktop app with offline sync capabilities.
- Add annotation tools (e.g., sticky notes) and export options for highlights/chats.
- Enhance AI with voice mode and multilingual support, aligning with future Grok features.
